    <h1 class = "fairfieldH">Why I am interested in Fairfield</h1>
    <pre class = "fairfieldtext">Fairfield is very determined in expanding their institution and work ethic globally. It 
        also promotes a sense of belonging, where everyone values each other 
        equally with one another. As someone who wants to be a web designer,
        I found the Bachelor of Science program in Computer Science appealing. This program 
        stresses that its students dive deep into their creativity and communicate
        with each other. I am a creative person who is able to communicate with anyone I work with.
        I know my creativity limits, but I know that this program will show me even more ways to
        come up with my own ideas.
